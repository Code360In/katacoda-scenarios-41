# add file to staging area

It is the time to inform git, that we wish to stage our changes.
to do so, execute command

`git add newfile`{{execute}}

this command added the file to the stage area, what can be seen after

`git status`{{execute}}

You see that the file is tracked and ready to be commited.

It is important to know, if you stage the file once, you don't need to
repeat this action again during the work.
