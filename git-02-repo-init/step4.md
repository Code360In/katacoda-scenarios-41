# Commit the file

Now it is the time to commit the file.

Commit is a proces to create a revision of the file. A version
which will be stored in Version Control.

Let's be sure that our file is staged

`git status`{{execute}}

Yes, it is, so let's commit it!

`git commit -m "my first commit"`{{execute}}

By adding `-m <comment>` we describe what this commit is about.

It is not the place here to explain the best practices how to
create commit messages, though.

`git status`{{execute}}

Now our file is commited and its version is created.
