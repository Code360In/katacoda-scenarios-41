# Remove files from commit

In the background our files were staged again and even commited.

Let's see

`git status`{{execute}}

There is nothing to commit odr to add to stage. To make sure that changes are commited,
execute

`git log`{{execute}}

Yes, they are. About git log we will talk in another scenario.

Also, you can see some modifications were done in files after previous commit.

`git status`{{execute}}

We have all 4 files in stage area.
